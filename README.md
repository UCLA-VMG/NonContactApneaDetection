The Supplement contains several folders for different components of the project:

1. data_collection, contains all code, circuit diagrams and instructions for running code related to capturing data from the thermal and radar sensors. 
2. preprocessing, after data-collection, the data requires pre-processing before being sent to the inference stage. The associated instructions for using our preprocessing library are located in the README in "preprocessing/mmProc"
3. inference/Apnea_Detection_Code, contains the scripts "apnea_detection.py" and "breathing_detection.py" and accompanying code for running breathing and apnea estimation.
