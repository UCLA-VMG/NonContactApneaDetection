# Sleep Apnea Detection using Envelope Detection

This folder contains the implementation of an envelope detection-based algorithm for identifying sleep apnea events from thermal and radar data. This algorithm extracts the breathing waveform from thermal imaging and radar signals, and detects anomalies corresponding to apnea events and the breathing rate of the patient.
